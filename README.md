# Android Application for Nerve Segmentation

Even the bravest patient cringes at the mention of a surgical procedure. Surgery inevitably brings discomfort, and oftentimes involves significant post-surgical pain. Currently, patient pain is frequently managed through the use of narcotics that bring a bevy of unwanted side effects.

This competition's sponsor is working to improve pain management through the use of indwelling catheters that block or mitigate pain at the source. Pain management catheters reduce dependence on narcotics and speed up patient recovery.

Accurately identifying nerve structures in ultrasound images is a critical step in effectively inserting a patientâ€™s pain management catheter. So for this purpose we developed a system that identifies nerve structure from the ultrasound images of the neck. Our system uses deep neural network to identify the patterns in the ultrasound images and identifies the nerve structure with the accuracy of 0.69%. I developed
